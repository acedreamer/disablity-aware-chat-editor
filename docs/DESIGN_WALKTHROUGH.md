# The Design Explained: A Simple Walkthrough

This document explains **what** the app looks like and **why** we designed it that way, in plain English. No technical jargon.

## 1. The General Look: "Calm and Clear"

### The Feeling
Imagine walking into a clean, quiet library. That is how the app should feel.
*   **No Clutter**: We removed anything that isn't 100% necessary.
*   **Soft Colors**: We don't use bright neon colors that hurt your eyes. We use soft teals (blue-green) and warm greys. It’s designed to be staring at a piece of paper, not a bright lightbulb.
*   **Rounded Everything**: Sharp corners feel "pointy" and aggressive. We rounded all the corners of buttons and boxes to make them feel friendly and safe.

## 2. How You Use It (The Layout)

We use a **"Split-Screen"** layout. Imagine opening a book with two pages.

### The Left Page: "Your Draft"
*   **What it is**: This is where you paste the email or text you are struggling with.
*   **The Design**: It’s just a clean white box. The text is big (larger than normal websites) so you don't have to squint.
*   **The Placeholder**: When it's empty, it says "Paste your text here..." in big, dark grey letters. We made sure it’s dark enough so you can actually read it (unlike some sites where it's too faint).

### The Right Page: "The Easy Version"
*   **What it is**: This is where the magic happens. The simplified text appears here.
*   **The Design**: It has a very faint blue background. This is a subtle visual trick to tell your brain: *"This side is distinct. This is the Result."*
*   **Visual Differences**:
    *   If the app added a word, it’s underlined in green.
    *   If it deleted a confusing word, it has a line through it (strikethrough), but it's faint so it doesn't distract you.

## 3. The "Magic Wand" (The Center)

Right in the middle, between the two pages, is the **Control Bar**.

*   **The Big Button**: There is one huge button in the center labeled **"Make it Simple"**. You can't miss it. It’s the most important thing on the screen.
*   **The Mode Switcher**: Above it, there are three clear tabs:
    1.  **Dyslexia**: For reading help.
    2.  **ADHD**: For focus.
    3.  **Autism**: For literal meaning.
    *   *Why tabs?* Dropdown menus hide choices. Tabs show you all your options at once, so you don't have to search for them.

## 4. Special "Superpowers" (Modes)

Here is how the design physically changes based on what you need:

### Dyslexia Mode
*   **What happens**: The text spreads out.
*   **Why**: People with dyslexia often see letters "dancing" or crowding together. We add extra space between letters and lines to stop this crowding.
*   **The Ruler**: A virtual "reading ruler" (a grey bar) highlights just the line you are reading, dimming everything else. It keeps your place for you.

### ADHD Mode
*   **What happens**: "Tunnel Vision".
*   **Why**: ADHD brains can get distracted by buttons and menus on the side. In this mode, the toolbar, the sidebar, and the footer all fade away. The only thing lit up is the text. It helps you hyper-focus.

### Autism Mode
*   **What happens**: "No Symbols".
*   **Why**: Some icons are confusing. What does a "hamburger" (three lines) mean? Menu? List? Food? In this mode, we replace icons with plain words. The "Trash can" icon becomes a button that just says **"Delete"**. No guessing games.

## 5. Safety Features ("Oops-Proof")

We know that making mistakes is frustrating. So we designed the app to be forgiving.

*   **No "Delete" without "Undo"**: If you accidentally clear your text, a little box pops up saying "Text Cleared" with a big **"UNDO"** button. You can always go back.
*   **Big Targets**: We made every button larger than normal. If your hands are shaky or you click a bit to the side, it still counts as a click. You don't have to be perfect.
*   **Clear Status**: The app never sits there silently. If it's thinking, it tells you "Thinking...". If it's done, it says "Done!". You never have to guess "Is it working?".

### Summary
The goal is to build an app that acts like a patient, helpful friend. It doesn't rush you, it helps you focus, and if you make a mistake, it helps you fix it.
